## Methodology
Two types of classification pipelines are built:

* Binary classification to classify toxic and non-toxic comments. Toxic comments are then labeled with their respective toxicity types. This is done because of a very imbalanced datasets.
* Multilabel classification

## Implemented Models

* Multichannel CNN with Fasttext embeddings
* BERT as a feature extractor followed by a Bi-LSTM for the classification
* Bi-LSTM with Fasttext embeddings
* Bi-GRU with Fasttext embeddings
